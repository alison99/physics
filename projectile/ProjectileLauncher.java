/**
 * ProjectileLauncher
 * @author Alison Chen
 * This class extends AbstractSimulation and creates an animation with a corresponding control panel, using the inherited method doStep().
 * doStep() loops every tenth of a second to move the object on the screen
 * stop() and reset() methods stop the program and reset the initial values respectively, while initialize() initializes the user-inputted values
 * 
 * The goal of this assignment was to create a program to model projectile motion on a graph of x and y position.
 * We sought to answer the question: "What is the best angle to hit a home run so that it goes directly over the wall?"
 * 
 * My program shoots multiple balls at varying angles within a range to test which angle just makes it over the wall.
 * My frame of reference consists of gravity downwards as negative, and wall a positive displacement to the right of the starting point.
 * The particles all have the same initial velocity, x- position, y- position, and acceleration to ensure that the only variable is the angle.
 * The user can input any of these values, including the range and the number of balls.
 * The effects of air resistance are included by using the drag coefficient of a baseball in both the x and y directions.
 * The particles will change color to indicate whether they fall short, hit the wall, or go over the wall.
 * The stop() method not only stops the program but also prints out the best angle for a home run
 * 
 * The most interesting part of this was seeing the difference that the effect of air resistance had on the best angle at a given velocity.
 * At 35ยบ, without air resistance, the best angle was 54.88ยบ, but with resistance it became 56.233ยบ
 * 
 * BalloonDarts Project:
 * For my personal project, I explored an extension of this question, by considering a carnival game where you throw darts to try to pop a balloon.
 * The question was: "What is the best angle to throw a dart so that it hits a balloon moving in a circle at a constant angular velocity,
 * at the bottom of its cycle, which is directly across from the height of your throw,
 * if you begin your throw at the same time that the balloon starts moving from the top of its cycle?"
 *
 * My program shoots multiple darts at various angles within a range to test which one hits the balloon.
 * The animation is a two-dimensional demonstration where the frame of reference is that of a person looking directly at the balloon.
 * Positive is upwards from the starting point where the balloon begins its cycle and the balloon ends its cycle at (0,0).
 * The balloon and particles are centered along the x-axis because the animation focuses on a particle moving directly forward and
 * thus the x position is always the same, while the y- position changes.
 * The particles all have the same initial velocity, y- position, and acceleration to ensure that the only variable is the angle.
 * The user can input any of these values, including the range and the number of darts.
 * The effects of air resistance are included by using the drag coefficient in both the x and y directions.
 * The BalloonDarts class extends AbstractSimulation, and contains all the inherited methods.
 * The doStep() method animates the moving balloon as well as the particles, which shrink in size to indicate that they are moving further away
 * The stop() method stops the program and prints the angle that hit the balloon.
 * stepY() is used to animate the motion of the particles on the screen, while stepX() calculates where the dart hit the wall as in ProjectileLauncher
 * If the dart hits the wall before the balloon arrives, the particle stops moving and changes color.
 * The program may print more than one angle due to the precision of the time step and rounding.
 * 
 * Since I could not find the coefficient for a balloon dart, I made the assumption that it was the same as the drag on a baseball.
 * Thus the air resistance is probably too much because darts have less mass and are a different shape, and thus move through the air differently.
 * The color of the dart changes to indicate whether it hit the balloon or if hit the wall before the balloon arrived.
 * The program ends when either the balloon has reached the bottom of its cycle or all the darts have reached the wall
 * By running this program along with the ProjectileLauncher with the same user inputted values,
 * one can model the trajectory of a three dimensional dart thrown at a wall containing a moving balloon from two different perspective: 
 * directly facing the balloon and seeing it from the side, which gives a complete picture through two-dimensional representation.
 * 
 * The most difficult part of the project for me and the area where I learned the most was trying to animate an object with uniform circular motion
 * I needed to understand how to determine the x and y position of an object at any given point based on its angular velocity, radius, and center of the circle.
 * I found x = a + r * cos(theta) and y = b + r * sin(theta) where x and y are the x and y positions respectively, (a,b) is the center, and r is the radius
 * Theta is the angle in radians that expresses the position of the balloon along the circle,
 * which is determined by the angular velocity (given in radians per second) multipled by the time step (given by the user input)
 * The step() method uses this formula to calculate the position of the balloon recursively every given time step
 * The position of the darts is determined by the y- position of a projectile moving as in the ProjectileLauncher
 * Since it is a two-dimensional representation, the x-position on the animation remains constant so the darts move along the y-axis.
 * If seen from the side however, the x-position of the particles change as given in ProjectileLauncher, which determines whether the darts hit the wall.
